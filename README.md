**The Javascript library for Fritzing data.**

 Easily parse all Fritzing data into ready-to-use Javascript objects. Complete with helper functions and documentation, `fritzing-js` provides a basic Javascript interface into the fundamentals of the Fritzing universe.

-------------------------------------------------------------

## Under Development

As of this writing, the library has transitioned from `stable` to `development` as we work on modularizing, documenting, and expanding it for official release on `npm`. You can still find the old version in the commit history, complete with basic examples and supportive of *all* Fritzing data types.

#### Milestones
- ~~parts module~~ (completed 2.9.2019)
- **sketch module**
- bundle module
- bin module
- testing
- release
